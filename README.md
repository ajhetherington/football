## Generic 2D football Project

Hi, welcome to this small repo, i'm working on a sort-of 2d football simulator, there's some general long term goals, but it is really for a bit of fun and to learn more rust.

The initial goal is to render 2 teams of 5 players on a pitch, then it's to try & get them to move randomly on the screen.

After that, it'll probably get quite hard in that i'll want to create the game engine...

Perhaps try and enable some user input?

Then each player should have their own AI based on their state of understanding of the game.

All getting a bit complicated... baby steps
